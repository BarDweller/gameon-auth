# Game On! Auth Service 

See the player authentication part of the player  service [information page](https://gameontext.gitbooks.io/gameon-gitbook/content/microservices/player.html) in the Game On! Docs for more information on how to use this service.

When we swap to this auth service proper, it'll have it's own section over in the gitbook =)
